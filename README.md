DARK_WEB_DATA_ANALYSIS


Abstractâ€”The dark web is a subset of the deep web, and it
is defined as hidden websites that require special software to
access. Users can use the dark web in the hopes of sharing files
and information with minimal chance of discovery. Therefore this
project will analyze the data on the dark web. It is important to
have fresh data from the dark web that is why a semi-automated
dark web crawler is required to collect data from data web
different marketplaces like agora, silk road, etc. In this project,
I have developed a crawler that uses queueing technique to collect
URLs from the dark web and then the queue starts collecting
data in textual form using the beautiful soup library, the data is
stored in HTML & textual form, and stored in mongo database
for future query application. The data is fed into an elastic search
cluster to get a quick response result of any query from the
frontend flask application. The analysis results show that the
respective result like Drug markets, gun markets, red rooms,
Data stealing, and hackers. The dark web is not always dark
only 25% of it is dark and 75% is white which means the dark
web is not only for illegal activities but there is also a good part
of the dark web like the freedom to write, and freedom to publish
any news without revealing identity.


VII. CONCLUSION
In this research, I have collected approximately 16000
pages which consist of drugs marketplace, hitman, erotic
pages, guns marketplace, and stolen information or data. By
applying some analysis on agora market place we come to
the result as expected. The result tells us about the various
markets place for example drugs, stolen information, publish
articles, and journals. It means the dark web is not only
dark according to my research 25% is only dark and the rest
is white. So we cannot say that the dark web is dark and
according to the analyzing data it is clear there is some part
of the dark web which is dark.
This research cover drug markets, weapons market, a sub
category of drugs like opioids, cannabis, tobacco, etc. it also
analyzes the stolen information and data like credit cards
PayPal, etc., and also cover a small part of the erotic category
and the results are discussed in the processing section.
